**Travel Recommendation System using AI and ML**
=====================================================

**Overview**
--------

This project aims to develop a comprehensive travel recommendation system that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide personalized travel suggestions to users.

**Key Features**
------------

* **Comprehensive Approach**: The system considers various factors such as user preferences, travel history, and real-time data to provide tailored travel recommendations.
* **AI-powered**: The system utilizes AI algorithms to analyze user behavior, preferences, and travel patterns to provide accurate recommendations.
* **ML-based**: The system employs ML models to learn from user interactions and adapt to changing travel trends and preferences.
* **Personalized Recommendations**: The system provides users with personalized travel recommendations based on their individual preferences and interests.

**Technical Requirements**
-------------------------

* **Data Collection**: The system collects user data through various sources such as user input, travel history, and social media.
